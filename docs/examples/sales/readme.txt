this dataset comes from kagle and is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data

just for testing purposes we also provide an Excel version of the same data and a couple of other files, namely:
- a word document
- a powerpoint document

the idea is to test the bot to read from multiple files in different formats


Sample Sales Data, Order Info, Sales, Customer, Shipping, etc., Used for Segmentation, Customer Analytics, Clustering and More. Inspired for retail analytics. This was originally used for Pentaho DI Kettle, But I found the set could be useful for Sales Simulation training.
